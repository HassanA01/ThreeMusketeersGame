The participants in the meeting: Mahmoud, Aneeq, Harshil, Faisal

Unfinished tasks: Command Pattern, Factory pattern, Visitor pattern, Singleton pattern for credits, some UI elements to allow the user to use classes related to these patterns.

What are practices that you should continue during the next sprint: Having regular meetings to update group members on what task everyone is on.

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during the next sprint: We need to change the way we plan our tasks such that we don't have to wait for someone else to
finish their work before we can begin working on our work.

What was the best/worst experience during sprint 1: The best experience was figuring out how to organize our tasks into different branches so everyone can freely work on their code
at the same time.
